# Streaming and UX Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enabled Streaming** âœ…
**File**: `/front-end/app/src/stores/useAgentStore.ts`

Changed the API request to enable streaming:
```typescript
const events = await apiClient.sendMessage({
  appName: API_CONFIG.appName,
  userId,
  sessionId: currentSessionId,
  newMessage: { parts, role: 'user' },
  streaming: true  // âœ… Enables real-time streaming from ADK
})
```

**Benefits**:
- Agent sends events as they happen (tool calls, reasoning, partial responses)
- Better user feedback during long-running operations
- Users can see progress in real-time

---

### 2. **Text Formatting Utilities** âœ…
**New File**: `/front-end/app/src/utils/text-formatter.ts`

Created utilities to clean up and format agent responses:

**Functions**:
- `formatAgentText()` - Removes excessive whitespace, fixes broken markdown
- `formatToolCall()` - Formats tool call information with emojis
- `formatToolResponse()` - Formats tool results  
- `formatCodeExecution()` - Formats code blocks with syntax highlighting
- `formatCodeResult()` - Shows code execution results with status indicators
- `createProgressMessage()` - Creates dynamic progress messages

**Example Output**:
```
ðŸ”§ **Tool Call:** lookup_matplotlib_docs with 2 parameter(s)
âœ… **Tool Result:** lookup_matplotlib_docs completed
ðŸ’» **Executing python:**
```

---

### 3. **Enhanced Response Processor** âœ…
**File**: `/front-end/app/src/utils/agent-response-processor.ts`

**Improvements**:

#### a. Better Text Handling
- Combines multiple text parts cleanly
- Removes excessive newlines and whitespace
- Ensures proper paragraph spacing
- Trims each line while preserving structure

#### b. Activity Narrative
Now builds a comprehensive narrative that shows:
- **Tool Activity**: Which tools were called and with what parameters
- **Code Execution**: What code ran and the results
- Combines narrative with main response text

**Before**:
```
If you invest an additional $10,000 at a 10% interest rate for 10 years...
```

**After**:
```
If you invest an additional $10,000 at a 10% interest rate for 10 years...

**ðŸ”§ Tool Activity:**
ðŸ”§ **Tool Call:** direct_chart_generator with 3 parameter(s)
âœ… **Tool Result:** direct_chart_generator completed

**ðŸ’» Code Execution:**
Executing python code...
Result: Chart generated successfully...
```

#### c. Streaming Support
- Processes partial events as they arrive
- Accumulates data across multiple events
- Tracks progress through tool calls, code execution, and text generation

---

### 4. **What Users Will See** ðŸŽ¯

#### During Request Processing:
1. **Tool Calls**: "ðŸ”§ Using lookup_matplotlib_docs..."
2. **Code Execution**: "ðŸ’» Executing python code..."
3. **Reasoning**: Agent thoughts are processed but not shown (filtered by `thought` flag)
4. **Results**: Clean, formatted final response

#### In the Final Message:
- Clean, properly formatted text
- Tool activity summary
- Code execution details
- Chart/visualization (if generated)
- All excessive whitespace removed
- Proper markdown formatting

## How Streaming Works with ADK

### Event Flow:
```
User sends message
    â†“
ADK processes with streaming: true
    â†“
Multiple events stream back:
  1. Event: functionCall (tool invocation)
  2. Event: partial text ("Analyzing...")
  3. Event: functionResponse (tool result)
  4. Event: executableCode (code to run)
  5. Event: codeExecutionResult (code output)
  6. Event: inlineData (chart image)
  7. Event: text (final response)
  8. Event: turnComplete (done)
    â†“
Response processor accumulates all events
    â†“
Formats and combines into single message
    â†“
Displays to user with clean formatting
```

### Event Types Handled:
- âœ… `text` - Main response content
- âœ… `functionCall` - Tool invocations
- âœ… `functionResponse` - Tool results
- âœ… `executableCode` - Code to execute
- âœ… `codeExecutionResult` - Code output
- âœ… `inlineData` - Images/charts
- âœ… `fileData` - File references
- âœ… `thought` - Internal reasoning (filtered out)
- âœ… `partial` - Streaming updates
- âœ… `turnComplete` - End of response

## Example: Before vs After

### Before (Messy):
```
If you invest an additional $10,000 at a 10% interest rate for 10 years, that investment is projected to grow to approximately **$25,937.42**. Adding this to your current net worth of $21,000, your projected net worth in 10 years would be **$46,937.42**. Here's a comparison of your current net worth and your projected net worth in 10 years with this investment: This chart visually represents the growth of your net worth with the additional investment. It shows a significant increase over the 10-year period due to compounding interest. ðŸ“Š Here's your net worth comparison: now vs. 10 years with investment:
```

### After (Clean):
```
If you invest an additional $10,000 at a 10% interest rate for 10 years, that investment is projected to grow to approximately **$25,937.42**.

Adding this to your current net worth of $21,000, your projected net worth in 10 years would be **$46,937.42**.

Here's a comparison of your current net worth and your projected net worth in 10 years with this investment:

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Features:

**Streaming**:
```typescript
// In useAgentStore.ts
streaming: true  // Set to false for non-streaming mode
```

**Tool Activity Display**:
```typescript
// In agent-response-processor.ts
// Tool activity is automatically included if tools are used
// Remove lines 239-243 to hide tool activity
```

**Code Execution Display**:
```typescript
// In agent-response-processor.ts
// Code execution is automatically included if code runs
// Remove lines 247-255 to hide code execution details
```

## Testing

**Test the improvements**:
1. Refresh the browser
2. Send a message that triggers tool use: "Show me a pie chart of my spending"
3. Watch the response - you should see:
   - Clean, formatted text
   - Tool activity summary
   - Code execution details (if applicable)
   - Chart display

**Expected behavior**:
- âœ… No excessive whitespace
- âœ… Proper paragraph breaks
- âœ… Tool calls shown with emojis
- âœ… Clean, readable output
- âœ… Streaming events processed correctly

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `/front-end/app/src/stores/useAgentStore.ts` - Enabled streaming
2. âœ… `/front-end/app/src/utils/agent-response-processor.ts` - Enhanced processing
3. âœ… `/front-end/app/src/utils/text-formatter.ts` - New formatting utilities

## No Backend Changes Required

All improvements are frontend-only. The backend ADK Web Server already supports streaming through the `streaming: true` parameter.
