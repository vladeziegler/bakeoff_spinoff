# Real-Time Streaming Implementation

## What Changed

### **Progressive Event Processing** ðŸŒŠ

The agent now shows updates **as events are processed**, not all at once at the end.

### How It Works

#### Before (All at Once):
```
User sends message
     â†“
[Wait for ALL events to complete]
     â†“
Show everything at once
```

#### After (Progressive Updates):
```
User sends message
     â†“
Show "Thinking..." immediately
     â†“
Event 1: Tool call â†’ Update UI (show tool call)
     â†“ (50ms delay)
Event 2: Tool response â†’ Update UI (show completion)
     â†“ (50ms delay)
Event 3: Text response â†’ Update UI (show text)
     â†“ (50ms delay)
Event 4: Chart data â†’ Update UI (show chart)
     â†“
Done!
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Immediate Placeholder**
```typescript
// Create placeholder message immediately
const initialAgentMessage = {
  content: 'Thinking...',
  status: 'sending',
}
// Add to messages right away
```

User sees feedback instantly, not after a delay.

### 2. **Incremental Processing**
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {
  const event = events[i]
  
  // Process this single event
  const partialProcessed = processor.process([event], true)
  
  // Accumulate results
  cumulativeToolCalls.push(...partialProcessed.toolActivity.calls)
  cumulativeText += partialProcessed.textContent
  
  // Update UI immediately
  updateMessage(agentMessageId, {
    content: cumulativeText,
    toolActivity: { calls: cumulativeToolCalls },
  })
  
  // Small delay for visual effect
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50))
}
```

### 3. **Cumulative Updates**
Each event adds to the previous state:
- Tool calls accumulate
- Text accumulates
- Code executions accumulate
- Images accumulate

The UI updates with the **full accumulated state** after each event.

## User Experience Timeline

### Example: "Show me a pie chart"

**T+0ms**: User clicks send
```
[User message appears]
[Agent: "Thinking..."]
```

**T+200ms**: Event 1 received (tool call)
```
[Agent: "Thinking..."]
[Tool Activity appears]
â€¢ Using transfer_to_agent (1 param)
```

**T+250ms**: Event 2 received (another tool call)
```
[Agent: "Thinking..."]
[Tool Activity updates]
â€¢ Using transfer_to_agent (1 param)
â€¢ Using cymbal_banking_agent (1 param)
```

**T+300ms**: Event 3 received (tool responses)
```
[Agent: "Thinking..."]
[Tool Activity updates]
â€¢ Using transfer_to_agent (1 param)
â€¢ Using cymbal_banking_agent (1 param)
Completed
â€¢ transfer_to_agent
â€¢ cymbal_banking_agent
```

**T+500ms**: Event 4 received (text response)
```
[Agent: "Here's your spending analysis..."]
[Tool Activity still visible]
```

**T+700ms**: Event 5 received (chart data)
```
[Agent: "Here's your spending analysis..."]
[Tool Activity still visible]
[Chart appears]
```

**T+750ms**: Final event (turn_complete)
```
[Agent message status: 'sent']
[Loading indicator disappears]
```

## Key Features

### âœ… Immediate Feedback
- "Thinking..." appears instantly
- No blank waiting period

### âœ… Progressive Updates
- Tool calls appear as they're processed
- Text builds up incrementally
- Charts appear when ready

### âœ… Visual Continuity
- Each update builds on the previous
- Smooth transitions (50ms between updates)
- No jarring replacements

### âœ… Clear Status
- "Sending" status while processing
- "Sent" status when complete
- Loading indicator visible during processing

---

## Technical Notes

### ADK Web Server Limitation
The `/run` endpoint returns **all events at once** (not true streaming). However, we simulate streaming by:
1. Processing the events array incrementally
2. Adding small delays between updates
3. Updating the UI after each event

### True Streaming (Future Enhancement)
For real Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming:
```typescript
// Would need SSE endpoint like /run-stream
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/run-stream?sessionId=${sessionId}`)
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
  // Update UI immediately
  updateMessage(agentMessageId, data)
}
```

This would require backend changes to support SSE.

## Files Modified

### `/stores/useAgentStore.ts`
- âœ… Added placeholder message creation
- âœ… Implemented incremental event processing
- âœ… Added cumulative state tracking
- âœ… Added progressive UI updates with delays

---

## Testing

**To see the streaming effect**:
1. Refresh browser
2. Send message: "Show me a pie chart of my spending"
3. Watch the updates:
   - "Thinking..." appears immediately
   - Tool calls appear one by one
   - Text builds up
   - Chart appears
   - Status changes to "sent"

**Expected behavior**:
- âœ… No delay before first feedback
- âœ… Tool activity appears progressively
- âœ… Smooth, incremental updates
- âœ… Professional, polished UX

---

## Benefits

### User Perception
- Feels faster (immediate feedback)
- Reduces anxiety (shows progress)
- Professional appearance
- Transparent process

### Technical
- Same API (no backend changes)
- Backward compatible
- Easy to enhance with real SSE later
- Minimal performance impact (50ms delays)

---

## Performance

- **Event processing**: ~50ms per event
- **Typical message**: 5-10 events = 250-500ms total animation
- **Network time**: Unchanged (same API call)
- **UI updates**: Efficient (React reconciliation)

The delays are intentional for UX - they make the streaming visible and professional.
